# Be a Paparazzo


![the pits](https://twoevilactors.files.wordpress.com/2015/03/despair.jpg "Pit of Despair")

A few students (the “Clients”) are sitting in class one day, and one of them, Chris, says, “You know, usually there’s nothing better than listening to Bobby, Jason and Sergey teach us JavaScript, but today, they’re kinda dragging.” Ramzi nods and responds, "Yeah, I'm totes in that pit of despair. It's a pity." No one laughed. Then another student, Salwa exclaimed, "I know! We need to see some celebrities." James thought about it for a sec and was like, "Dude, I live in the village. I see celebrities every day; I'd rather code." Then Chris responds by saying, "Yeah, but I know that there a couple film screenings going on in the area. We need to see them in action!"

At this point, Ramzi's attention is captured. He knows that just one errant cameo could get him noticed and bring him that instant fame he's always deserved. Salwa is certain that people would immediately recognize her design sensibilities and ask her to redesign the set, and James just shrugs and says, "whatevs. I guess I’ll just have to get invited to another celebrity party. I know: let’s be lame and take pictures of all of them!“

They all stand up, cameras in hand, ready to embark on their paparazzi quest but just stand there motionless. They don’t know where any film sites are located. They need a website!

It turns out that there’s a NYC database that indicates where and when shooting permits have been acquired, and that can provide the basis for a website that would assist these users.

**User Stories**

* As users, the Clients want to be able to load the page and see a map of New York with icons displaying where shooting permits are currently effective.
* As users, the Clients want to be able to hover over the icons to get a modal window with more details regarding the permits, including the start and end dates, where parking is held and whether the permit is for film or television.
* As users, the Clients want to be able to enter a zip code into a search bar at the top of the page and submit a search which causes the map to zoom in on the selected area, allowing for a greater focus on events in that vicinity.
* As users, the Clients want to be able to login to both record and see a history of the shooting sites they’ve visited. To record which sites they’ve visited, they would like to click a “been there” button in the modal for shooting sites that they’ve visited. Those sites would then be populated in a collapsible sidebar that displays the history of sites that logged in users have visited.
* As users, the Clients want there to be some browser responsiveness
* As users, the Clients want to see a footer that indicates the site was built with love by students of General Assembly.

The requirements for the MVP are listed above in the user stories. The site will be built using React, Express, NYC Open Data’s and Google Maps’ APIs…
